Fossickers Doom
=================

Welcome to the Fossickers Doom project. This project is taking a game, and changing to our own game.
We have permission by the original owner for all of this.

Want to know what the objective and all other stuff is? Continue to the doc.

Quickstart
----------

To set it up...
windows: gradlew idea
mac/linux: ./gradlew idea

Do `./gradlew <task>` to compile and run the project, where `task` is:

* Desktop: `desktop:run`
* Android: `android:installDebug android:run`
* iOS: `launchIosDevice` or `launchIphoneSimulator` or `launchIpadSimulator`
* HTML: `html:superDev` (this doesn't work yet, some classes need to be changed)
* Generate IDEA project: `idea`
