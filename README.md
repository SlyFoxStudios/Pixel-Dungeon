IT WORKS!

Quickstart
----------

To set it up...
windows: gradlew idea
mac/linux: ./gradlew idea

Do `./gradlew <task>` to compile and run the project, where `task` is:

* Desktop: `desktop:run`
* Android: `android:installDebug android:run`
* iOS: `launchIosDevice` or `launchIphoneSimulator` or `launchIpadSimulator`
* HTML: `html:superDev` (this doesn't work yet, some classes need to be changed)
* Generate IDEA project: `idea`
